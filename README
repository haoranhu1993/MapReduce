This is my first assignment for Operating Systems Design 198:416.

The purpose of this project was to teach the principles of parallel programming through threads and processors. We implemented the MapReduce algorithm for two different sorting tasks:

1)Word-Count: given a text file, organize its content in alphabetical order and count the number of appearances of each word

2)Int-Sort: given a text file of just numbers each on its line, sort the numbers in ascending order

The assignment.pdf provides more details of the requirements for this project and report.pdf further describes our implementation.
